# Docker-Compose & Traefik reverse Apps

This repository contains all my Traefik configuration files and the applications I use every day.

It contains applications like :
- Tiny Tiny RSS
- Wallabag
- Joplin Server
- Basic Wordpress config

And, of course, Traefik, who has the reverse-proxy of applications.

This setup is quite simple to set up. 
Articles at [tech.redscapemusic.com](tech.redscapemusic.com) will soon be written to explain my stack.
